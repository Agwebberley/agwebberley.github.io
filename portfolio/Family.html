My Family<br>
</h3>
  <p>Thanksgiving, for most, is a holiday for families. Thanksgiving is the time that people travel all over to see extended family or stay at home and have a nice turkey dinner. Some of my favorite memories have been going to my grandparent’s house for thanksgiving where I get to see all of my extended family, our extended family is quite a crowd.  For my family, Thanksgiving dinner includes Turkey, Ham, Mashed Potatoes, Sweet Potato Casserole, Gravy, Cranberry Sauce, Bread, and Deserts. I love seeing extended family at Thanksgiving but my favorite part is the turkey feast.  When coming up with a simile for my family I thought of all this and I think that my family is like a turkey dinner.</p>
  <p>I think that family for a Christian is your brothers and sisters in Christ. The people that a Christian is the closest to should be their fellow brethren in Jesus Christ. A believing family is a two-fold blessing as you can be close to them in relation and in Christ. It is no greater blessing than to be part of a Christian family with two loving parents and even siblings. In a sermon series about a year ago, Pastor John Street in his fellowship group, Joint Heirs gave five purposes for the family: [The family is the] Antidote to loneliness, The husband and wife is the primary relationship, [the family is] a place where people are to be honored, [the family is] a classroom where the most important lessons in life are taught and learned, and [the family is] a place of refuge in times of stormy weather in life (Street). Having a Christian family is a blessing in that you have a family that you can be closest to and you are also the same in wanting to please and honor Christ. Family is one of the most important institutions.
  The institution of the family is one of God’s given restraints for sinners. Pastor John MacArthur recently preached a sermon on God’s four restraints on sinners and in it, he said “Family is the divinely created institution for the formation of restrained sinners who by generations of morality, discipline, love, virtue, and obedience become a benefit to society, enjoy God’s gifts, and are grateful.” (MacArthur). He explained that for sin to run rampant Satan must destroy the family and has done so through children outside of marriage, abortion, and homosexual “families”. He went on to explain that Satan must also destroy the conscience, government, and the church. Without the family, we would lose that safeguard and defense which God has given us.</p>
  <p>My father is like the turkey in a turkey dinner. As the most important part of the "meal," he is the heart and sets the tone of the family. He provides the main substance, the protein of the meal. He not only provides financially but also is spiritual guidance in our family because he strives to learn the things of God to impart them to his children and his wife through morning or evening devotionals with discussions afterward that can last hours. He is our faithful disciplinarian which I probably will not fully appreciate until I am older, “All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. (Hebrews 12:11 NASB).” He also provides practical wisdom and advice to help my siblings and me through life’s journey. He stands between me and my fleshly desires on occasion which at the time is not pleasant but looking back I am grateful. Not to mention the amazing example he sets for me to follow. If I am half the man my father is, I will do well in life.  </p>
  <p>My mother is like the plate of a turkey dinner. She is possibly the most underrated and most essential part of the “meal.” She also holds the whole family together. My mother is possibly the most necessary to the functioning of the household because without her the dishes would never be done, the laundry would be piled a mile high, and none of my family would have dinner. My mother has given up so much for me. She has homeschooled my siblings and me from the start, and even though now she has trouble helping me, without the academic foundation that she set, I would not be where I am now. She, even though various health problems, works hard every day with the never-ending chores always piling up. The plate is more important than you may realize.</p>
  <p>I have unique siblings whom I have likened to sweet potato casserole with marshmallows and gravy. My younger sister, Kristen, who is fourteen is like the sweet potatoes with marshmallows casserole in a turkey dinner because she is sweet “marshmallows” most of the time but every once in a while all you get is “sweet potatoes.” She has a severe peanut allergy and often complains about it when my brother and I get something she can’t but she is always willing to help when others have needs. As of late, we are getting more sweet potatoes than marshmallows, but my mother tells me that the marshmallows eventually will be back. My younger brother, Michael, who is twelve is like the gravy of a turkey dinner because he adds a little spice to life but sometimes there is a little too much of him. My brother can be enigmatic, kind, compassionate, and is fun to play with but sometimes he wants to play at inconvenient times or he needs a lot of help, so much so that sometimes it makes it challenging to get my work done. Michael can have a bit of a roller coaster ride of emotions but when someone gets hurt he wants to help in any way he can. My siblings were chosen before the foundation of the earth by God, and I will always love them even though they can be annoying.  </p>
  <p>I would not be the person I am today without the treasures that are my grandparents, my grandparents are like the deserts in a turkey dinner because, at least in my family, everyone loves the many different kinds of deserts. We used to do nearly everything with my grandparents and we loved seeing them. Since the second grade, we have gone to Grace Community Church with them and had lunch afterward until my grandfather died from a heart attack on December 1, 2014. The last time I saw my grandfather actually was the thanksgiving dinner at his house. Many members of my family including my grandmother have after comparing me to a picture of my grandfather from when he was about my age that says we look very much alike. Not only do we look alike but I have also inherited a lot of traits from my grandfather, for example, my grandmother would always make him two eggs and toast for breakfast, and if I had the choice that is how I would start every morning as well. Also, both my grandfather and I love to see Dodgers baseball games, he even took me to a couple of Dodger games. I spent so much time with my grandfather, his favorite game was checkers, and I will always remember him as one of the greatest men to ever live.  My grandmother rarely lets us leave her house without ice cream, pie, or most often both. We still take my grandmother to church and eat lunch with her afterward. I have learned to treasure what little time I may have with my grandmother. 
  Family can be a wonderful thing, especially if the family strives to honor and obey Jesus Christ. Thanksgiving for Americans is a time to bring families together. As much as I love Thanksgiving dinner I love my family more. Family can be the biggest blessing a person can have.
