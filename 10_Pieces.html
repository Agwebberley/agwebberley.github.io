  <h1>Description</h1>

  <p style="font-size:22px;">
A computer is more than a number-crunching box of components, it is a gateway to more things than imaginable.  The computer is a "gateway" to many things.  It is a gateway to long-distance communication with people from all over the world, to games that bring friends together by virtually destroying each other, to create, and many more possibilities. To create is my favorite "gateway", there is so much you can create. You can create applications to help people, games to bring people together, animations to tell stories, and so much more.</p>

  <p style="font-size:22px;">I think that family for a Christian is your brothers and sisters in Christ. The people that a Christian is the closest to should be their fellow brethren in Jesus Christ. A believing family is a two-fold blessing as you can be close to them in relation and in Christ. It is no greater blessing than to be part of a Christian family with two loving parents and even siblings. In a sermon series about a year ago, Pastor John Street in his fellowship group, Joint Heirs gave five purposes for the family: [The family is the] Antidote to loneliness, The husband and wife is the primary relationship, [the family is] a place where people are to be honored, [the family is] a classroom where the most important lessons in life are taught and learned, and [the family is] a place of refuge in times of stormy weather in life (Street). Having a Christian family is a blessing in that you have a family that you can be closest to and you are also the same in wanting to please and honor Christ. Family is one of the most important institutions.
